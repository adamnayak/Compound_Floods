# Compound Floods
This public repository contains all code for the project entitled: "A Nonstationary Stochastic Simulator for Clustered Regional Hydroclimatic Extremes to Characterize Compound Flood Risk."

Below I outline the files included in the repository and their contents. 

NOTE: This repository and associated code is currently under maintenance and in process of being refined to enhance user access and implementation. Please contact directly about current code files. Once research is formally published, all code should be up to date and this message will be removed.

# Repository Contents

## Main.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook is the main script to run the compound flood simulator. The notebook is broken into sections. The section entitled "Input Parameters" allows users to specify all necessary model inputs.

## Wavelet.py
This python file contains all functions for wavelet transformation and signal processing steps.

## Trend.py
This python file contains all functions for trend extraction.

## Forecast.py
This python file contains all functions for signal forecasting.

## NS_Cluster.py
This python file contains all functions for modified Neyman-Scott Clustering.

## Data_Load.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook allows for rapid pre-processing of hydrologic timeseries to format data properly for input. Script assumes data is directly scraped from USGS and requires inputs based upon the data source.

If you have general questions about the code, model, or data please feel free to reach out and I am always happy to try to do my best to help out. If you're interested in using similar method or working on a new project, I am always looking to collaborate and am happy to contribute more broadly! Email is always in flux - but try me at adam.nayak@columbia.edu, adam.nayak@alumni.stanford.edu, adamnayak1@gmail.com, or feel free to ping me on LinkedIn.
